    "1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- The def keyword is used to define normal functions, while the lambda keyword is used to define anonymous functions. They are, however, limited to a single line of expression. They, like regular functions, can accept several parameters."

    "2. What is the benefit of lambda?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- Lambda helps you use a function only once, and hence, avoids cluttering up the code with function definitions. In short, Python's lambda keyword lets you define a function in a single line of code and use it immediately."

    "\n",
    "Ans- The differences between map, filter and reduce are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. map(): The map() function is a type of higher-order. This function takes another function as a parameter along with a sequence of        iterables and returns an output after applying the function to each iterable present in the sequence. \n",
    "2. filter(): The filter() function is used to create an output list consisting of values for which the function returns true. \n",
    "3. reduce(): The reduce() function, as the name describes, applies a given function to the iterables and returns a single value"
