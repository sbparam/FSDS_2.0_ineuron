    "\n",
    "Ans- The relative path is the path to some file with respect to your current working directory (PWD).\n",

    "- ‘r+’ – Read/Write Mode: Use this mode if you need to simultaneously read and write to a file.\n",
    "- ‘a’ – Append Mode: With this mode the user can append the data without overwriting any already existing data in the file.\n",
    "- ‘a+’ – Append and Read Mode: In this mode you can read and append the data without overwriting the original file.\n",
    "- ‘x’ – Exclusive Creating Mode: This mode is for the sole purpose of creating new files. Use this mode if you know the file to be          written doesn’t exist beforehand."

    "\n",

    "- The read() would treat each character in the file separately, meaning that the iteration would happen for every character.\n",
    "- The readline() function, on the other hand, only reads a single line of the file. This means that if the first line of the file were     three lines long, the readline() function would only parse (or iterate/operate) on the first line of the file."
