    "Ans: When users enter stock ticker symbols, several issues may arise, and it's crucial to handle them appropriately to provide a good user experience and ensure accurate information retrieval. Here are some potential issues and ways to handle them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Invalid Ticker Symbol:**\n",
    "   - **Issue:** Users might enter a ticker symbol that doesn't correspond to a valid stock.\n",
    "   - **Handling:** Validate the entered ticker symbol against a known list of valid symbols. Provide feedback to the user if the symbol is invalid and prompt them to enter a valid one.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Case Sensitivity:**\n",
    "   - **Issue:** Ticker symbols are often case-sensitive, and users might enter them in the wrong case.\n",
    "   - **Handling:** Convert the entered symbol to the correct case before processing. This ensures that \"AAPL\" and \"aapl\" are treated as the same symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Whitespace and Extra Characters:**\n",
    "   - **Issue:** Users might unintentionally include whitespace or extra characters in the symbol.\n",
    "   - **Handling:** Trim leading and trailing spaces and ignore any extraneous characters. Clean up the input before processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ambiguous Ticker Symbols:**\n",
    "   - **Issue:** Some ticker symbols might represent multiple securities or have similar names.\n",
    "   - **Handling:** If ambiguity exists, provide the user with options or additional information to help them choose the correct symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Network or API Errors:**\n",
    "   - **Issue:** Network issues or errors from the data source may occur when attempting to retrieve information for the entered symbol.\n",
    "   - **Handling:** Implement error handling and provide informative messages to the user. Consider offering suggestions or retrying the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Symbol Changes or Delistings:**\n",
    "   - **Issue:** Ticker symbols can change, or companies may be delisted.\n",
    "   - **Handling:** Regularly update the list of valid ticker symbols and inform users if a symbol is no longer valid. Provide guidance on finding the new symbol if applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **User Input Mistakes:**\n",
    "   - **Issue:** Users may make typographical errors while entering symbols.\n",
    "   - **Handling:** Implement fuzzy matching or correction mechanisms to suggest or auto-correct potential mistakes in the entered symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Security Identification Number (CUSIP) vs. Ticker Symbol:**\n",
    "   - **Issue:** Users might mistakenly enter a CUSIP (Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures) instead of a ticker symbol.\n",
    "   - **Handling:** Differentiate between ticker symbols and CUSIPs. Provide clear instructions to users on the required format.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Limited Data for Certain Symbols:**\n",
    "   - **Issue:** Some symbols may represent less liquid or less-known securities, leading to limited data availability.\n",
    "   - **Handling:** Inform users about the limitations and provide whatever information is available. Consider displaying a disclaimer for less common symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **User Education:**\n",
    "    - **Issue:** Users might not be familiar with the correct format or naming conventions for ticker symbols.\n",
    "    - **Handling:** Include clear instructions or tooltips to educate users on how to enter ticker symbols correctly."
