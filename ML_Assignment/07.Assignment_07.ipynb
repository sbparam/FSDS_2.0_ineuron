    "What does it mean to overfit? When is it going to happen\n",
    "Overfitting happens when a model learns the detail and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data. This means that the noise or random fluctuations in the training data is picked up and learned as concepts by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the sense of model fitting, explain the bias-variance trade-off\n",
    "The bias is known as the difference between the prediction of the values by the ML model and the correct value. Being high in biasing gives a large error in training as well as testing data. By high bias, the data predicted is in a straight line format, thus not fitting accurately in the data in the data set."
