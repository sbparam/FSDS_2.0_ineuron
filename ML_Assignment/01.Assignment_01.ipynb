    "Ans: Machine learning popularly known as ML is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values. As it is evident from the name, it gives the computer that makes it more similar to humans: The ability to learn. Machine learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many more places than one would expect."

The Machine Learning systems which are categorized as instance-based learning are the systems that learn the training examples by heart and then generalizes to new instances based on some similarity measure. It is called instance-based because it builds the hypotheses from the training instances. It is also known as memory-based learning or lazy-learning. The time complexity of this algorithm depends upon the size of training data. The worst-case time complexity of this algorithm is O (n), where n is the number of training instances.\n",

We often use a cost function or similar to determine what the parameter value has to be in order to minimize the function. The model makes prediction by using the value of the new instance and the parameters in its function. The goal for a model-based algorithm is to be able to generalize to new examples. To do this, model based algorithms search for optimal values for the model's parameters, often called theta. This searching, or \"learning\", is what machine learning is all about. Model-based system learn by minimizing a cost function that measures how bad the system is at making predicitons on new data, plus a penalty for model complexity if the model is regularized. To make a prediction, a new instance's features are fed into a hypothesis function which uses the minimized theta found by repeatedly running the cost function."

To build the test set we split the training data (50-50, 60-40, 80-20 are common splits) into a training set and test set. Our model is training with the training set. Then we use the model to run predictions on the test set. Our error rate on the test set is called the generalization error or out-of-sample error.
