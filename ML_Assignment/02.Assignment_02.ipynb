The agent receives rewards by performing correctly and penalties for performing incorrectly. The agent learns without intervention from a human by maximizing its reward and minimizing its penalty. Example: Suppose there is an AI agent present within a maze environment, and his goal is to find the diamond. The agent interacts with the environment by performing some actions, and based on those actions, the state of the agent gets changed, and it also receives a reward or penalty as feedback."

The goal of ML, in simples w ords, is to understand the nature of (human and other forms of) learn- ing, and to build learning capability in computers. To b e more specific, there are three aspects of the goals of ML. (1) T o make the computers smarter , more intelligent. The more direct objecti ve i n this aspect is to develop systems (programs) for specific practical learning tasks in application domains. (2) T o dev elop computational models of human learning process and perform computer simulations. The study in this aspect is also called cognitive modeling. (3) T o explore new learning methods and de velop general learning algorithms independent of applica- tions.\n",

    "Humans have the ability to learn, however with the progress in artificial intelligence, machine learning has become a resource which can augment or even replace human learning. Learning does not happen all at once, but it builds upon and is shaped by previous knowledge. Humans acquire knowledge through experience either directly or shared by others. Machines acquire knowledge through experience shared in the form of past data. We have the terms, Knowledge, Skill, and Memory being used to define intelligence. Just because you have good memory, that does not mean you are intelligent."

    "Ans: In Machine Learning, Abstraction is supported primarily at the level of modules. This can be justified in two ways: first, Data abstraction is mostly a question of program interfaces and therefore it arises naturally at the point where we have to consider program composition and modules. Abstraction is defined as dealing with ideas instead of events. In the context of AI, that means worrying more about what the right algorithm is and less about how to implement it. Another way of looking at it, for those technically inclined, is as an API call (abstracted) vs. a self implemented function or series of functions."

    "An example is when we train a model to classify between dogs and cats. If the model is provided with dogs images dataset with only two breeds, it may obtain a good performance. But, it possibly gets a low classification score when it is tested by other breeds of dogs as well. This issue can result to classify an actual dog image as a cat from the unseen dataset. Therefore, data diversity is very important factor in order to make a good prediction. In the sample above, the model may obtain 85% performance score when it is tested by only two dog breeds and gains 70% if trained by all breeds. However, the first possibly gets a very low score (e.g. 45%) if it is evaluated by an unseen dataset with all breed dogs. This for the latter can be unchanged given than it has been trained by high data diversity including all possible breeds.\n",

    "It should be taken into account that data diversity is not the only point to care in order to have a generalized model. It can be resulted by nature of a machine learning algorithm, or by poor hyper-parameter configuration. In this post we explain all determinant factors. There are some methods (regularization) to apply during model training to ensure about generalization. But before, we explain bias and variance as well as underfitting and overfitting."
